# Introduction

**Expected Threat (xT)** is a widely used metric to evaluate players’ actions based on how much they increase the likelihood of scoring. This submission aims to bring a new dimension to the xT metric by introducing a **context-aware decision quality measurement system** that penalizes xT values resulting from **non-optimal decisions**. By using **SkillCorner’s passing options** concept, I propose the **Decision – xT (D-xT)** metric, which adjusts traditional xT values by incorporating **decision quality** and penalizing actions that reflect **suboptimal decision-making**.
